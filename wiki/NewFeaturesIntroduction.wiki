1. RobotServer

First let's take a quick look over the three methods listed below:
{{{
public void setDisplayPictureEx(String displayPicture, String deluxePicture) throws RobotException;
public void pushMessage(String robot, String user, RobotMessage message) throws RobotException;
public void requestResource(String robot, String user, RobotResource resource, String saveUrl) throws RobotException ;
}}}

  * The *setDisplayPictureEx()* method's second argument represents a larger display picture to show, so we call it a deluxe picture.
  * The signature of *pushMessage()* method is changed, now it accepts a RobotMessage object, so you can specify your favourite font's style and color.
  * *requestResource()* is the most interesting method to be introduced.What does a resource represent for? When you receive a wink or a voiceclip, they are the resources which you can request to get them.How? Just specify the *saveUrl* argument, then we will post the data to this saveUrl.You may also specify it as *null*, we'll provide saveUrl for you(To know more about this, please visit [http://code.google.com/p/botplatform/wiki/BotPlatformRESTfulService]).
